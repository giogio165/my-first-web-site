    <h2>Life span</h2>
    <p>I regularly hear from people that said their Dachshund lived to be 17 or 18 years old.<br>
      The oldest verified Dachshund was a doxie-mix named Chanel from New York,<br>
      who lived to age 21 and even spent time in the Guinness World Record book as the world’s oldest dog.<br>
      Rocky, a Dachshund in Shingle Springs, CA is claimed to have lived to the ripe old age of 25 (almost 26!).</p>
